#Scientific Calculator made using Pygame

This is one of my first projects made during pygame, and I had a lot of fun making it. It was the first time I tried making elements scale based on window size (I had to draw a diagram ;-;) and it was interesting solving problems like how to code for order of operations especially. My solutions, although probably unorthodox, helped show me how to think like a programmer and have enhance my skills. I also had fun making a screen to change colors (press "c") and making customs sounds that make the UI much more interesting and polished. Scientific Calculator was one of my first big projects, and I am glad I did it.

Like the Desmos scientific caluculator in that it actively displays the answer to valid expressions. Additionally, each expression and answer can be moved up to start another expression. Multiple operations can be done simutaneously, including the standard 4 operations, square root, pi, exponents, negative numbers, and parenthesis. Also automatically calculates according to Order of Operations.

Window can also be resized and components will adjust accordingly.

CALCULATOR CAN BE USED AT https://pyroprotato.github.io/scientific_calculator/ OR https://pyroprotato.itch.io/calculator

Latest Update 12/1/2024: Added new screen that allows the user to change the colors of the calculator buttons. Press "c" to access it.
